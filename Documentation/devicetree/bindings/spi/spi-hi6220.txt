Hi6220 SPI controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "arm,pl022", "arm,primecell"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain SPI controller interrupt
- num-cs : total number of chipselects

Required Board Specific Properties:

- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.

Optional properties:
- cs-gpios : should specify GPIOs used for chipselects.
  The gpios will be referred to as reg = <index> in the SPI child nodes.
  If unspecified, a single SPI device without a chip select can be used.
- dmas : Two or more DMA channel specifiers following the convention outlined
         in bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: Names for the dma channels, if present. There must be at
	     least one channel named "tx" for transmit and named "rx" for
             receive.

Example:
             spi_0: spi@f7106000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl022", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0x0 0xf7106000 0x0 0x1000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <0 50 4>;
			bus-id = <0>;
			enable-dma = <1>;
			dmas =	<&dma0 12 &dma0 13>;
			dma-names = "rx", "tx";

			clocks = <&clock_sys HI6220_SPI_CLK>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_pmx_func &spi0_cfg_func>;
			num-cs = <4>;
			cs-gpios = <&gpio6 2 0>, <&gpio6 3 0>, <&gpio6 4 0>, <&gpio6 5 0>;

			status = "ok";
		};
